            The foundation of Abasyn University is deeply rooted in the vision
            and commitment of its founder, Dr. Imran Ullah. After completing his
            MBA from Sull State University in the United States in the late
            1990s, Dr. Imran Ullah chose to return to Pakistan with a
            determination to contribute to the development of higher education
            in his homeland. His first initiative was the establishment of the
            Abasyn Institute in Peshawar, which began offering a range of
            bachelor’s and master’s degree programs in affiliation with Gomal
            University. This step marked the beginning of a journey toward
            building an institution dedicated to academic excellence, innovation,
            and service to society.

            Driven by his ambition to create an independent and fully chartered
            university, <b>Dr. Imran Ullah</b> worked tirelessly to secure
            official recognition. His efforts bore fruit in <b>2009</b> when the
            Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Provincial Assembly granted a charter for Abasyn
            University. This milestone transformed the institute into a
            degree-awarding institution, setting the stage for its rapid growth
            and expansion in the years to follow. Building on its momentum,
            Abasyn University sought to extend its educational reach to other
            regions of Pakistan. In <b>2012</b>, the University received a{" "}
            <b>No Objection Certificate (NOC)</b> from the Higher Education
            Commission (HEC) of Pakistan to establish a campus in the federal
            capital, Islamabad. This expansion not only broadened the
            University’s footprint but also enabled it to cater to a more
            diverse student population. Today, Abasyn University operates{" "}
            <b>two thriving campuses</b> — in Peshawar and Islamabad — offering
            an array of programs that span undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral
            levels.

          <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
            Currently, the University runs approximately{" "}
            <b>50 academic programs</b> across multiple disciplines, with more
            than <b>9,000 students</b> enrolled. Over the past <b>15 years</b>,
            the institution has proudly graduated more than{" "}
            <b>16,000 students</b>, many of whom are making meaningful
            contributions in their respective professions both nationally and
            internationally. The University’s dedication to providing quality
            education, coupled with its emphasis on <b>research</b>,{" "}
            <b>innovation</b>, and <b>community service</b>, has earned it a
            strong reputation as a center of learning in Pakistan.

            In <b>2017</b>, Abasyn University expanded its commitment to
            education beyond higher studies by establishing a{" "}
            <b>school dedicated to primary and secondary education</b>.
            Recognizing the importance of a strong academic foundation for young
            learners, the University developed a purpose-built campus in{" "}
            <b>Peshawar</b> to house this initiative. The facility, spanning
            over <b>80,000 square feet</b> and comprising <b>60 modern
            classrooms</b>, was designed to provide an environment conducive to
            learning and personal growth. Today, the school serves more than{" "}
            <b>850 students</b>, and over <b>100 students</b> have already
            successfully completed their <b>secondary education (Class 10)</b>.
            The school has quickly established itself as a beacon of quality
            education for the local community, embodying the University’s
            mission to uplift society through learning at all levels.
